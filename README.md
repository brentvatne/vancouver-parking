# Vancouver Parking

## About

Car2Go provides a fantastic API to their live parking spot data, but
they do not use it in their official application and the third party
applications that do use it are lacking in features.

I think that if someone took the time to clean up some of the data and
provide a bit more information about each spot, which could be easily
obtained by someone living in the area, parking with Car2Go could be
even easier.

## Use cases

#### I'm about to go to X, where can I park near X?

#### I'm near X, where should I park?

#### I usually park in designated parking spot X, are there any free spaces?

#### I know there is a parking spot near X, I'd like to see what it looks like so I don't miss it.

#### Can I park in this metered parking spot? What parking rules are in effect in Vancouver right now?
